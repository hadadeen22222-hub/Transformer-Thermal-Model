How to run the code

There are 4 folders for different sections of the report. Each folder contains one or multiple MATLAB files which includes the code that produced a graph of that section: The folders are:

1- Methodology
2- Results 4.1
3- Results 4.2
4- Results 4.3

P.S. some MATLAB files will ask for a .CSV file before it runs. In that case, ONLY choose Wind_Inputs11.csv

//////

There are two .CSV files: 

1- Inland Wind Farm Dataset : it includes the real-life data of a wind turbine acquired from Literature Review

2- Wind_Inputs11 : It's a modified version of the wind turbine's power output data from the CSV file but in a simpler version so the MATLAB code can read it.
